# ImpactsOf_DailyLifeAct_OnWell-beingðŸ’–
I am Esin. I am sophomore Computer Science student with a minor in Decision and Behaviour. I have been always passionate about human psychology and well-being. In the future I want to work on a more of a combination of technical and data-driven job in the psychology domain. I am interested in the effects of NLP techniques on humans and the combination of Human-Computer Interaction.
Here is my project for DSA210 (Introduction to Data Science and Analytics).
