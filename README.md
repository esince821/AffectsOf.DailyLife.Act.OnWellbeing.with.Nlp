# ðŸ’«Impacts of Daily Life Activities on Personal Well-being
I am Esin. I am sophomore Computer Science student with a minor in Decision and Behaviour. I have been always passionate about human psychology and well-being. In the future I want to work on a more of a combination of technical and data-driven job in the psychology domain. I am interested in the effects of NLP techniques on humans and the combination of Human-Computer Interaction.
Here is my project for DSA210 (Introduction to Data Science and Analytics).

## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s rapidly changing world, the rise of Artificial Intelligence is transforming every aspect of life and work. The future of automation is uncertain yet full of opportunities. I think, with globalization and increasing interconnectedness through technology and communication, caring for oneâ€™s well-being has become more crucial than ever.

This project aims to explore the relationship between daily activities and itsâ€™ impacts on mental state. Over approximately 10 days, I will record and analyze my daily activities with itsâ€™ amount, mood, and reflections. By examining the data, I hope to identify what helps me feel relaxed, what triggers stress, and ultimately how I can improve my overall well-being.

## Motivation

Having a data-driven objectives for my daily activities can contribute to my personal development and increase my awareness. By keeping a detailed record of my daily routinesâ€”like a personal journalâ€”I can better understand how I spend my time and become more mindful of my day-to-day habits. Moreover, I have always been passionate about reading books and listening to podcasts on personal well-being and NLP. I aspire to work in related fields in the future, and I see this as a meaningful first step toward that goal.

## Research Questions

- What type of activities make people feel good or stressful?
- How much sleep is enough? //How much sleep is sufficient to maintain a stable mood and high energy during the day
- Does spending time with others increase well-being regardless of who the person is (friend, family, coworker, etc.)?
- Does physical activity (e.g., walking, stretching, exercise) have a measurable impact on mood?
- How does screen time â€” especially on social media â€” influence mental well-being?
- Is there a connection between time spent outdoors and feelings of calm or satisfaction?
- Can small daily routines (like gratitude or mindfulness) have cumulative effects on well-being over time?

## Data Collection

This analysis will be conducted using personal data. I will record my daily activities for ten days. I will choose for a degree of mood(1-10), sleep amount, the activity type and its amount, social media consumption amount, social time with mentioning with whom and also with a brief side note about the day to analyse with NLP in a csv file.

## Timeline

This is a sample of my day-to-day records.

| Date | Activity Type | Activity Amount | Sleep Amount(hours) | Social Media Consumption Amount(hours) | Social time and with whom | Side Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 27.10.2025 | Walking | 1.5 hours | 8 hours | 1 hour | 2 hours-close friend | Felt relaxed and productive |
| 28.10.2025 | Lecture | 3 hours | 6 hours | 2 hours | NaN | Felt Stressed |

## Limitations

Since this study is limited to around ten days, the data may not be sufficient for generalized conclusions. Human life is complex, and many external factors can influence well-being beyond daily activities. Future iterations of this project could extend the time period or include additional variables for a more comprehensive analysis.
