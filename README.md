# ImpactsOf_DailyLifeAct_OnWell-beingðŸ’–
I am Esin. I am sophomore Computer Science student with a minor in Decision and Behaviour. I have been always passionate about human psychology and well-being. In the future I want to work on a more of a combination of technical and data-driven job in the psychology domain. I am interested in the effects of NLP techniques on humans and the combination of Human-Computer Interaction.
Here is my project for DSA210 (Introduction to Data Science and Analytics).
## Project Overview

As world goes to more automated path, people encounter human-made robots and computers more. Not to forget our humanity people need to spend time for their well-beings. In this project, I will measure the effects of our daily life activites on our mental state and well-being. I will record my daily activities day-by-day for approximately 10 days with a side notes in words and analyse the data that I collected. 

// connect your goal into more rational and todays worlds perspective

## Motivation

Having a data-driven objectives for my daily activities can contribute to my personal development and increase my awareness. I have always been interested in reading books and listening podcasts about personal well-being and nlp. In addition, I want to work in this field in the future and this may be a starting point for me.

//you can be better

## Research Questions

- What type of activities make people feel good or stressful?
- Is sleep amount is important for well-being and how much time is enough?
- Is spending time with others increases well-being no matter who he/she is?

//more detail  

## Data Collection

I will record my daily activities for ten days. I will choose for a degree of feeling good(1-5), sleep amount, the activity type and its amount, side notes about the day, social media consumption amount, social time with mentioning with whom in a csv file.

// add more technical terms

## Limitations

The activities can expand when we can record more days since life has every perspectives approximately 10 days may be not enough for a more generalized conclusion.

// make it more detailed

## Future Work

I will work in Human-Computer Interaction Lab in the next semester and I can improve my project adding new perspectives.

// make it more detailed
